title: MORPC Insights | Historic and Forecasted Population by Year
description: 'This dataset provides the best available historical and forecasted population
  estimates for the Central Ohio region and the counties and communities therein.  Estimates
  are compiled from a variety of sources including the following: Census Intercensal
  Estimates (CENINT), Census Population Estimates Program (CENPEP), Mid-Ohio Regional
  Planning Commission (MORPC).  Note that different sources provide estimates as of
  different days throughout the year, so be sure to note the entire date in the REFERENCE_PERIOD
  field.  The VINTAGE_PERIOD field refers to the time that the estimate was produced
  or released.  Earlier and (perhaps) later vintages may be available from the original
  sources.'
